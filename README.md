# Runelite Plugin: NPC Attack Ticks Tracker

This is a Runelite plugin created by Hypsster that adds a counter above the heads of NPCs to track their attack ticks.

# Usage

Once the plugin is installed and enabled, the attack tick counter will appear above the heads of NPCs in the game. The counter will show the number of game ticks until the NPC's next attack. This information can be useful for players who want to time their attacks or avoid taking damage from the NPC's attacks.
